Who doesn't want to be their own task master?

### Easy Stuff ###
1. Input a task in the Task description text box
2. Choose a priority for the task in the *select*
3. Click **Add new task**

That wasn't so hard, was it?

Tasks expire after 7 days. But of course, since you're very organized and on top of things, you can complete a task early, using the button of the same name.

Completed and expired tasks will move to the *Task History* view. If the task is still unexpired and you want to bring it back to the *Active Tasks* view, just click **Uncomplete task**.

## What's up with that name? ##
Sometimes you just want tasks Gone. And sometimes, when you gone them, you want to do it with emphasis: Grrr!
